    People. I’m loyal to my friends, not to any ideals.­ Everyone ­else ­can ­take ­a trip ­on the River Styx for all I care.

abilities:
  - name: Sneak Attack
    desc: |
      Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a Dexterity-based attack (such as with your shortsword or shortbow) and you have advantage on the attack roll, you can deal an extra 3d6 damage to your target. You don’t need advantage if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it and isn’t incapacitated. You can’t deal the extra damage, however, if you have disadvantage on the attack roll.
  - name: Lucky
    desc: |
      When you roll a natural 1 on an ­attack roll,­ ability­ check,­ or­ saving­ throw,­ you­ can­ reroll the die and must use the new roll.
  - name: Brave
    desc: |
      You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
  - name: Halfling Nimbleness
    desc: |
      You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.
  - name: Criminal Contact
    desc: |
      You have a contact who acts ­as your liaison to a network of other criminals. You know how to get messages to and from your contact, even over great distances; you know the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can carry messages for you. You can move secret information or stolen goods through your contact in exchange for money or other information ­you ­seek.
  - name: Naturally Stealthy
    desc: |
      You can attempt to hide when you are obscured by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.
  - name: Cunning Action
    desc: |
      Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly, so you can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.
  - name: Second-Story Work
    desc: |
      You gain the ability to climb faster than normal, so climbing no longer costs you extra movement. In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.

    desc: |
      You know thieves’­ cant,­ a­ secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. You also understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous, whether loot is nearby, or whether the ­people ­in ­an area ­are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.
